 post the new task to the correct date, resulting in the creation
  of a new daterange

- **Resize a task:** Try to stretch it, but it's not possible in the
month view, unless it's an all day task.

- **Add a new daterange to a task:** The task needs to be associated
with a tag, then drag the tag to the calendar to create and link a new
daterange
